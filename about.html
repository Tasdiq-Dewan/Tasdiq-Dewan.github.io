                <p> Hello, I'm Tasdiq Dewan, a Tech Specialist at QA Consulting</p>
                <p>I studied Computer Science at Queen Mary University of London, where I graduated in 2019. 
                    After graduating I worked freelance as an English and Maths tutor at Eye Level. During this time I taught children from ages 5 to 12 years old.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In 2021 I worked as a digital archivist at the Guardian News & Media Archive as part of the Bridging the Digital Gap programme with The National Archives.
                    During my time on this programme I developed key skills and knowledge within the archive sector, with a focus on digital archiving and digital preservation.
                    Some of the projects I worked on included the transciption of Clyde Sanger's notebooks, the oral history project for The Guardian's 200th anniversary celebrations, the improvement of the GNM archive's web recording and digital ingest procedures, and the improved digitsation of the archive's MiniDisc collections.
                </p>
                <p>For more information on my time in the GNM Archives, please take a look at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2022/jan/12/a-year-in-the-bridging-the-digital-gap-traineeship">blog post I wrote for the Guardian's website</a></p> 
                <br>
                <p>
                    In 2022 I joined QA Consulting, going through their training in the QA Academy to become a Tech Specialist.
